# Summary
The risk of using strictly in AI systems in industry has led to the pursuit of collaborative systems between humans and AI, or Intelligent Augmentation (IA) systems. These systems may be prone to conflict between the human and AI when there are differences in observation, interpretation, and control action.

## Introduction
Although the development of fully autonomous systems is being pursed, particularly with neuro-symbolic AI, it is more realistic to expect applications of AI to be a collaborative effort between humans and AI. The failure of systems to properly account and allow for human-AI collaboration often can lead to conflicts and hazardous situations.
