# Summary
The risk of using strictly in AI systems in industry has led to the pursuit of collaborative systems between humans and AI, or Intelligent Augmentation (IA) systems. These systems may be prone to conflict between the human and AI when there are differences in observation, interpretation, and control action.

## Introduction
Although the development of fully autonomous systems is being pursed, particularly with neuro-symbolic AI, it is more realistic to expect applications of AI to be a collaborative effort between humans and AI. The failure of systems to properly account and allow for human-AI collaboration often can lead to conflicts and hazardous situations. 

## Human and AI operations in IA systems
Effective IA systems will allow for human-AI collaboration in which input flows both ways. In plant operations, for example, there must be a balanced system which incorporates both AI and human observations, allowing each agent to monitor provide input and monitor the quality data of the other. Human-in-the-loop is an approach in which humans monitor in real time the quality of AI data and algorithms. AI-in-the-loop is an approach in which the AI provides input to the human to assist in decision making. Both of these approaches may cause conflicts. 

## Human-AI conflict
Conflicts may arise due to observation, interpretation, and control actions.

### Observation Conflict
Observation conflict is the disagreement between data sensed by the agents. This
