# Motivation
Multi-Agent Systems, or MAS, are distributed systems, composed of a number of autonomous software entities called agents. MAS have internal behaviors and external interactions between agents.

## Internal Behaviors
- Type of agent cognition and performance measure (reactive, model-based, goal-based, and utility based)
- How adaptive agents are
- How agents characterize their environment
- Agent Autonomy
# External Behaviors
- How agents share tasks and information
- How they interact with other social organizations
- Degree of agent cooperation

Agents communicate with an Agent Communication Language (ACL), which specifies message semantics of content and communication context.

MAS need to be supported by generic distributed computer infrastructure, or set of middleware services. Agents need an execution environment in which they can invoke services and transport messages. This is provided by the agent's Information Communication Technology (ICT) environment, often called the MAS platform. 

Agents and agent platforms are often heterogeneous, presenting a major challenge. Thus the paper seeks to provide public and standard specifications for MAS.
