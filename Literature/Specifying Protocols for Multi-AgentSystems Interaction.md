# Motivation
Multi-Agent Systems, or MAS, are distributed systems, composed of a number of autonomous software entities called agents. MAS have internal behaviors and external interactions between agents.

## Internal Behaviors
- Type of agent cognition and performance measure (reactive, model-based, goal-based, and utility based)
- How adaptive agents are
- How agents characterize their environment
- Agent Autonomy
# External Behaviors
- How agents share tasks and information
- How they interact with other social organizations
- Degree of agent cooperation

Agents communicate with an Agent Communication Language (ACL), which specifies message semantics of content and communication context.
