# Summary
The paper proposes a model to quantify and resolve conflicts which result from discrepancies in human and AI observation, interpretation, and action. The mathematical model is based on conventional human conflict resolution mechanisms. The authors claim the model promotes human-AI collaboration with real-time response to human input. 
## Introduction
Although AI has developed human-like skills, their decision making deviates from human expectations. This phenomenon is described as human-AI conflict, which can often be "mistakenly interpreted as faults, failures, or cyberattacks". Because of the anthropomorphic characteristics  of AI decision making, a potential solution could be to use human-human conflict resolutions models such as  the Thomas-Kilmann Instrument. Currently, control systems "lack the capability to perceive and integrate human observations and actions with the data they collect", which prevents human-AI collaboration in their use cases.
