# Summary
The paper proposes a model to quantify and resolve conflicts which result from discrepancies in human and AI observation, interpretation, and action. The mathematical model is based on conventional human conflict resolution mechanisms. The authors claim the model promotes human-AI collaboration with real-time response to human input.
