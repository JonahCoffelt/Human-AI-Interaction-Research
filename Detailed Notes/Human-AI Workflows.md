# Identified Problem
As [AI](AI.md) continues to develop proficiency in human-like skills and reasoning, it has become increasingly adopted into industry [workflows](Definitions/Workflow.md) . These workflows often involve both AI and human [agents](Agent.md) which introduces conflict related to human-AI interaction. Human-AI conflicts usually arise as a result of differences in observation or interpretation.

# Aim
Our aim is to mitigate the [risk](Definitions/Risk.md) of conflict in human-AI workflows by curating the design and topology of the workflow to be intuitively effective given the involved agents and goal. This aim is twofold: The solution should minimize human-AI conflict both on the governance and operation levels. Humans should have sufficient priority in the design of the workflow and significant roles in the execution of the workflow. The workflow should maximize collaboration and minimize competition between agents

# Methodology


# Considerations
There are several considerations taken into account in our solution:
1. Assignment of tasks should be curated to the [Expertise](Expertise.md) of the given agents.
2. There should be human-AI redundancy in order to mitigate both human and AI failures
3. Where there is redundancy, the inputs from humans and AI should be weighed according to circumstance, agent type, and agent expertise
