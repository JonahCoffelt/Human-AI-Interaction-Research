# Introduction
Advances in AI models and techniques has lead to an increased adoption of AI in industry. Most notably, LLMs exhibit impressive observation, interpretation, reasoning, and decision making abilities. With these developments in human-like skills, AI is being used for many applications across various fields with increased autonomy and integration into workflows. These workflows often include both human and AI agents, requiring interaction between the two. These interactions create novel conflicts which must be taken into consideration when designing, managing, and operating workflows. 

We define a workflow as a series of tasks performed in sequence or parallel aimed at a particular goal. A workflow is considered effective if it satisfies the goal and abides by necessary constraints; it is more efficient if it is able to do all this faster or cheaper. Additionally, we would consider a workflow resilient if it is able to withstand potential intermediate failures while still satisfying the goal.

The tasks of a workflow are completed by agents. An agent is a person or thing that takes autonomous physical or symbolic actions, resulting in an effect in a particular environment. For the purposes of this paper, an agent may be one of two types: human or AI.
