# Revisiting Previous Discussions
- Why was $R=P+S$ used for risk rather than $R=P\cdot S$?
	- Still unsure. I looked into some works on risk and found that in most cases, as you said, risk was a product of these two measures. My best guess would be that risk is typically a scalar used to evaluate the expected utility or harm of an action or choice, whereas here the authors' model uses a vector form of risk that can be minimized on two axes.
- What models of human decision making could we use?
