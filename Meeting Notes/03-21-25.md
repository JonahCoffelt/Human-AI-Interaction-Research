# Discussion Points
- [Specifying Protocols for Multi-Agent Systems Interaction](Specifying%20Protocols%20for%20Multi-Agent%20Systems%20Interaction.md)

# Potential Thinking
- I currently have a very task/workflow oriented implementation of the framework
- We could switch to a context-focused design
	- Provide an environment for agents
	- Specify Communication Acts
	- Examples of how to specify a context
		- Energy ...
		- Chemical Plant
		- Software dev
- Included in the context (Dynamically updates)
	- Agents
	- Tasks
	- Tools/Capabilities
- Central to this design is the Communication Act specification. This would define the interface, allowing agents to:
	- Send data to others
	- Send requests
	- Interact with tasks
	- Create tasks
	- Create tools
- How our goals fit into this model
	- Workflows could easily be created by just adding tasks to the environment
	- Rather than implementing a whole different system for governance, the manager agents would simply be agents with higher access levels
		- This fits our desired agents attributes
- Pros:
	- More flexible
	- Easier to use
	- Conforms more to FIPA
	- Wider application set
	- Fixes some of the current implementation problems
	- More dynamic
- Cons:
	- Requires code rewrite
	- May be too broad

# Notes
- All possible Governance Actions
	- Create/remove/edit tasks
	- Create/remove/edit tools
	- Employ agents
	- Manage agent permissions
	- Manage the context
	- Oversee operation
	- Collect performance metrics
