This paper identifies 5 personality traits that correlate with personal career success. We have had some desire to include notions of trust in our frame work, and I think this categorization gets at a similar idea in a different way.

## Big FiveTraits
### Neuroticism
- Characterized by an increased tendency to experience negative emotions, such as anxiety, worry, irritability, and moodiness.
### Extraversion
- Characterized by an outward focus on the external world and a tendency to gain energy from social interaction

- This could be represented by a model of the agent confidence, this is is what tends to lead the agent interactions in the case of a conflict. 
###  Openness
- Level of imagination, curiosity, creativity, and willingness to embrace new experiences and ideas

- Very similar to agreeableness, but maybe it could also exist outside of interactions. We could focus on the imagination part. 

### Agreeableness
- Propensity for being cooperative, trusting, and empathetic, characterized by kindness, altruism, and a desire for social harmony

- This could be represented by the agents likelihood to change their answer

### Conscientiousness
- Characterized by traits such asÂ being organized, disciplined, reliable, and goal-directed

- We could hone in on the reliable aspect; this could simple be how accurate the agent is generally. 

## Application
My thought is that we could collect data for this
