This paper identifies 5 personality traits that correlate with personal career success. We have had some desire to include notions of trust in our frame work, and I think this categorization gets at a similar idea in a different way.

## Big FiveTraits
### Neuroticism
- Characterized by an increased tendency to experience negative emotions, such as anxiety, worry, irritability, and moodiness.
### Extraversion
- Characterized by an outward focus on the external world and a tendency to gain energy from social interaction

- This could be represented by a model of the agent confidence, this is is what tends to lead the agent interactions in the case of a conflict. 
###  Openness
- Level of imagination, curiosity, creativity, and willingness to embrace new experiences and ideas

- Very similar to agreeableness, but maybe it could also exist outside of interactions. We could focus on the imagination part. 

### Agreeableness
- Propensity for being cooperative, trusting, and empathetic, characterized by kindness, altruism, and a desire for social harmony

- This could be represented by the agents likelihood to change their answer

### Conscientiousness
- Characterized by traits such asÂ being organized, disciplined, reliable, and goal-directed

- We could hone in on the reliable aspect; this could simple be how accurate the agent is generally. 

## Application
My thought is that we could collect data for these traits as the workflow progresses and have them influence the conflict resolution block. For example:
- Agents with high **extraversion** could have adjusted confidence values
- Agents with high **openness** could be asked to provide alternative solutions or ideas
- Agents high **agreeableness** could be asked to further explain their conclusion so that they are not unfairly overridden 
- Agents with high **conscientiousness** could be weighted better in an override situation

## Potential Issues
The papers specifically notes that these characteristics are tied to career success as it pertains to occupational prestige, income, and job satisfaction. These may not be the things we want to maximize in our workflow.
