# Revisiting Previous Discussions
- Existing Multi-Agent Frameworks
	- AutoGen
		- Agent: An entity that can send and receive messages to and from other agents in its environment. Agents may have the following four components: LLM, code executor, tool executor, and human-in-the-loop. Agents may also be assigned roles.
		- Human-In-The-Loop: This component allows for human input to be requested never, after a termination condition, or always. ![](Images/Pasted%20image%2020250218075137.png)
		- Tool Use: According to the docs, agents can search the web, perform calculations, read files, or call remote APIs. Any prewritten python code can be executed in this way.
	- MetaGPT
		- Primarily focused on software development. Seems very limited in use case scope compared to AutoGen. This framework outperformed the other other two existing frameworks two out of three times in the [paper](Flow%20â€“%20A%20Modular%20Approach%20to%20Automated%20Agentic%20Workflow%20Generation.md), but all of their examples were software development based. 
	- CAMEL
		- Worse performance and features than both.
	
	- It is pretty clear to me that AutoGen is the most promising of the existing frameworks. The human-in-the-loop component is a nice inclusion, but I do not think it goes as far as we would like it to go. 
	- Conflict resolution and human action scope.
- Procedure decision
	- I would like to talk more about this
