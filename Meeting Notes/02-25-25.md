# Discussion Points
- Worked on the paper
	- Any suggested changes?
	- Next steps?
- Worked on implementation
	- Expected result from topological sort
		- Used for calculating parallelism

# Notes
- Spanning tree protocol
- Maximizing trust
	- Will allow for better day-to-day operations
	- Be aware to not have blinding trust
	- Zero-trust
	- Maybe have zero trust conflict resolution strategies on the management level but maximize trust in the operation level.
