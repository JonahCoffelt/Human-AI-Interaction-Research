# Discussion Points
- MCP & FIPA
	- FIPA is a collection of standards for agent-agent communication and interaction
	- MCP is a protocol for agent-server communication
	- These two systems are not opposed to each other, in fact they are actual great compliments
- Implementation
	- Way better now (cleaner, more flexible, and easier to use)
- Writing
	- Have filled in FIPA, MCP, and some of the model specifications

# Notes
- Collect performance metrics
	- Collect Failure
	- Task Exec Time
	- CPU and Mem usage
